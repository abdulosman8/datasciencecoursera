Each row in the data is compromised of one of 30 individuals who participated in the study  labelled as:

Subject 

Each subject has the Mean and Standard Deviation of the following variables:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The Run Analysis Script does the following:

1 -Merge the training and test data from the above link
2- Extract Mean and standard Deviation from those files
3- Label each colum and row appropriately
4 - combine the clean and tidy products
